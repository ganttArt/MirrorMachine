# Planning

## To Dont's

- Refactoring code into one mirroring function
  - Makes sense todo for readability, but requires a lot of time and diving into the code with little payoff
- Web application: p5.js + vanilla javascript
  - Has a very small chance of meaningful monitization.
  - Has potential to be more accessible/used to others, but little personal benefit.
- Save full size image
  - Would save some time afterwards with brining the image into photoshop and mirroring there too, but I would probably be bringing it into photoshop anyway.
  - Saving is currently based on saving what is being displayed on the screen. Saving something larger would require a full redesign of the saving function.
